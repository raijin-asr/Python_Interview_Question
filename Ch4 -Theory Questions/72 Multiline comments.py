# ""Does Python Have Multiline Comments?
# Python natively doesn't support multiline comments. In Python, there is only one way to write a comment and that is using the # symbol.

# However, to write multiline comments, we can use # at the beginning of every line. Another way to add multiline comments is by using multiline string.

# In Python, we can write multiline strings by enclosing strings with three (double) quotation (""") marks. For example,""
"""
This
is 
string
"""

# Similarly, we can place this string anywhere we want without storing it in any variable, thus making it act like a multi-line comment. Here's an example of it,
# This is a single-line comment
# written as a multi-line comment
print('Hello')
 
"""
This is a multi-line string
that acts as a multi-line comment
"""
print('world')
