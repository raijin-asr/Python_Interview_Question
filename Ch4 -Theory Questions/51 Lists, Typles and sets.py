# Explain Lists, Tuples, and Sets
# List

# A list is a collection of data. It is similar to arrays but can store non-homogeneous data. For example
values = [5, 'John', 19.25]

# We use square brackets, [], to define a list. Python lists are mutable, i.e., elements can be appended, removed, and changed.

# Elements in a list are ordered and can be accessed using its index.

# Tuple

# Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. That means that elements in tuples cannot be changed, appended, or removed. For example,
values = (5, 'John', 19.25)

# We use parentheses, (), to define a tuple.

# Set

# Sets are also similar to lists. However, they do not allow duplicate elements. For example,
# Error: duplicate elements
values = {1, 2, 4, 2}

# Valid
values = {1, 2, 3, 4}

# We use curly braces, {}, to define sets.

# Elements in a set are unordered, meaning, we cannot access them using indexes.
