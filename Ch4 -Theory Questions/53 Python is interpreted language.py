# What Do You Understand When Someone Says, "Python is an Interpreted Language"?
# Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages are executed line by line, unlike compiled languages, where the whole program is executed at once.

# This means that even if there is an error in line 32, we will execute the code successfully till line 31.

# In short, the Python interpreter executes instructions directly without compiling the entire program into machine language.
